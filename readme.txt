Optimized Instagram is a WordPress widget plugin that pulls instagram images, creates thumbnails, and then saves those images on your server.

== Description ==

Optimized Instagram is a WordPress widget plugin that pulls instagram images, creates and optimizes user-specified exact size thumbnails, and then serves those images locally from a subdirectory in your siteâ€™s /wp-content/uploads/.

If a user clicks on one of the thumbnails on the front end, that image links over to the instagram image in a new browser window, or you have the option of opening a larger image in a lightbox (via the WP Lightbox 2 plugin).

= Recommended lightbox plugins =
* [Responsive Lightbox by dFactory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/responsive-lightbox/)
* [WP Lightbox 2](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-lightbox-2/)
* [FancyBox for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fancybox-for-wordpress/)
* [WP jQuery Lightbox](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-jquery-lightbox/)
